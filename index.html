            <p class="lead">
              Hey there! I’m Skandana Gowda, and I’m absolutely fascinated by
              how technology, especially software and data, can come together to
              solve real-world challenges. With a year of professional
              experience in software development, I’ve had the chance to dive
              deep into projects that really pushed my problem-solving skills
              and allowed me to collaborate with amazing engineers.<br /><br />
              But everything changed after I attended this incredible talk on
              the power of data science and machine learning. It was one of
              those “aha” moments when I realized just how much I wanted to
              explore this field! That talk ignited a whole new passion in me
              for roles like Data Scientist and ML Engineer, where I can blend
              my software development background with the potential of data to
              create meaningful insights. I’m truly excited about both
              development and data, and I can’t wait to bring my energy, skills,
              and curiosity to a variety of tech roles. <br /><br />Let’s
              connect and see where this journey can take us!
